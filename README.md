Switch Displays is a script I wrote so that I could quickly reconfigure monitors

I wrote it because I have different configurations of monitor at home and at work so wanted something that I could specify the layout shape but it would auto-detect which monitor it needs to apply the changes to.

I'm aware of autorandr but that expects you to have the same layout every time the same monitors are detected. I wanted to specify different layouts. I've also seen similar using python - I wanted a native bash one.

It can do with a lot of improving - pull requests welcome
